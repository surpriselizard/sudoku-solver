# sudoku-solver

This project is to make a program that solves a sudoku puzzle. The first version is very user-unfriendly but it works. You have to input your unsolved
sudoku puzzle into the code and the solved puzzle is printed out into the console.

The next version will have a full graphical user interface where you can input numbers in each cell, and when you are done inputting your puzzle
you press 'Solve Puzzle' and it wil present an animation as it solves your puzzle (or it doesn't if it is impossible to solve).
